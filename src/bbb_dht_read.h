// base = 1 and number = 13.  Humidity and temperature will be returned in the provided parameters.
// If a successfull reading could be made a value of 0 (DHT_SUCCESS) will be returned.  If there
// was an error reading the sensor a negative value will be returned.  Some errors can be ignored
// and retried, specifically DHT_ERROR_TIMEOUT or DHT_ERROR_CHECKSUM.
